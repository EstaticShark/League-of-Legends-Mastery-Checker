# League-of-Legends-Mastery-Checker
A simple program that displays a summoner's top 3 champions sorted by mastery points.

The program requires both a League of Legends API key and a summoner name consisting of only Python literals to work.
Make sure you have the ast, json and requests modules and then insert the summoner name in line 14 and run the program to request information on their top 3 champions.
