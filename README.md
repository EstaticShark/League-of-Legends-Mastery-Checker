# League-of-Legends-Mastery-Checker
A simple program that displays a summoner's top 3 champions sorted by mastery points

The program requires both a League of Legends API key and a summoner name consisting of only Python literals to work.
Just insert the summoner name in line 14 and run the program to request information on their top 3 champions.
